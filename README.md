# Music and AI
## A Selection of Demo Codes Illustrating Historical Foundations

---

These codes were partly written for a presentation in April 2025. The repository includes some older codes from seminars and much older experiments as well.

They are meant to illustrate the concept of abstraction in general, and after that, transitions from traditional algorithmic to ML generated music. Particularly, they illustrate rule-based (deterministic) systems, chance operations and probabilistic/stochastic music generation, symbolic AI, and the beginnings of neural networks. The codes intend to show more than music generation, but also applications like music analysis and music-related tasks (OMR). None is meant to be a "real" solution to a "real" problem, but just a series of demos illustrating technological principles.

Thanks a lot to Natasha Niaz and Durga Ram for teaching me C and Python!
